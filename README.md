# Archive_Node_Sync_v12.0

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TECHNICAL PORTFOLIO ARCHIVAL SYSTEM**
> Engineered for high-fidelity technical demonstration, featuring fluid "Smooth Relay" transitions and a minimalist, data-driven aesthetic.

## System Overview
This portfolio serves as a centralized archive for high-performance software modules. It is built on a React 19 foundation, utilizing Framer Motion for deterministic UI transitions and Tailwind CSS for a minimalist, obsidian-themed presentation.

## Integrated Stack
- **Frontend Architecture**: React 19 (Functional Components, Hooks, Context)
- **Animation Engine**: Framer Motion (Scroll-driven transforms, layout orchestration)
- **Styling Paradigm**: Utility-first CSS via Tailwind
- **Form Intelligence**: Integrated Web3Forms with custom validation logic
- **Routing**: Optimized for SPA delivery via Netlify Redirect Protocols

## Core Modules
- **VaultLock Secure SaaS**: Multi-tenant cloud storage with server-side quota governance.
- **View My View P2P**: Browser-to-browser encrypted media tunneling via WebRTC.
- **Zero Touch Vision**: Multimodal landmark inference using MediaPipe pipelines.
- **Galaxy Cluster Mass Analysis**: SQL-based gravitational mass distribution modeling using SDSS data.
- **JWST MIRI Spectral Extraction**: Integral field unit cube processing via Astropy.
